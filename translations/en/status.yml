  The disaggregation status tab provides an overview of how many Sustainable Development Goal indicators include data disaggregated according to the United Nations (UN) requirements for each indicator, with some exceptions. Proxy indicators that differ significantly from the UN metadata are assessed using national standards and are considered fully disaggregated when these standards are met. Proxy indicators that align closely with the UN metadata continue to be evaluated against the UNâ€™s disaggregation requirements. Indicators with the following statuses are considered out of scope: <i>data not available</i>, <i>data not applicable</i>, and <i>exploring data sources</i>
