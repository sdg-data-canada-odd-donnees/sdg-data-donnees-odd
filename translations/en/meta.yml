    <p>In the public provincial and territorial systems in Canada, <b>100% of teachers have received at least the minimum organized teacher training</b> as these education systems are highly regulated. Thus, by definition, teachers in the system must meet these requirements in order to teach within that system. No information on private schools are available.</p>

    <p>Canada has comprehensive birth registration systems in place. It is a legal requirement to register all births in Canada. Registrations do not fall under federal jurisdiction, but under  provincial and territorial Vital Statistics Acts. There is no direct measure of number of children who are unregistered. As registration is comprehensive, a figure of 100% is used. More information on provincial and territorial vital statistics can be found at <a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/about/relevant/vscc/organisations">Member organisations - Vital Statistics Council for Canada</a>.</p>
