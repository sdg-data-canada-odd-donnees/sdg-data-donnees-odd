They are competent to: (i) provide and promote evidence-based, human-rights based, quality, socio-culturally sensitive and dignified care to women and newborns; (ii) facilitate physiological processes during labour and delivery to ensure a clean and positive childbirth experience; and (iii) identify and manage or refer women and/or newborns with complications. <br> ","DATA_COMP":"Data were readily available to report to this indicator as specified by the metadata.

As of April 30, 2015, registration can occur in the absence of one or two of the forms, thus contributing to the increase observed between 2011 and 2012. <br><br> Due to improvements in methodology and timeliness, the duration of data collection has been shortened compared to previous years. As a result, there may have been fewer births and stillbirths captured by the time of the release. The 2022 data are considered preliminary. <br><br> As a result of delays with birth and stillbirth registrations, fewer births and stillbirths have been captured, to date, for Manitoba in\u00a02022.
