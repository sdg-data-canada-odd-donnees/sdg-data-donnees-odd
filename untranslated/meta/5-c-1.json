This is an indicator of characteristics of the fiscal system. It is not an indicator of quantity or quality of finance allocated for gender equality and women&#x2019;s empowerment (GEWE). The indicator measures three criteria. The first focuses on the intent of a government to address GEWE by identifying if it has programs/policies and resource allocations to foster GEWE. The second assesses if a government has planning and budget tools to track resources for GEWE throughout the public financial management cycle. The third focuses on transparency by identifying if a government has provisions to make allocations for GEWE publicly available.</p>","<h2><u>For Criterion 1:</u></h2>"],"DATA_COMP":"   ","REC_USE_LIM":"   ","SDG_GOAL__GLOBAL":"<p>Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls</p>","SDG_TARGET__GLOBAL":"<p>Target 5.c: Adopt and strengthen sound policies and enforceable legislation for the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls at all levels</p>","SDG_INDICATOR__GLOBAL":"<p>Indicator 5.c.1: Percentage of countries with systems to track and make public allocations for gender equality and women&#x2019;s empowerment</p>","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"UN Women, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-05-0c-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 4.0 MB)","fr":{"SDG_GOAL":"   ","SDG_TARGET":"   ","SDG_INDICATOR":"   ","STAT_CONC_DEF":"   ","DATA_COMP":"   ","REC_USE_LIM":"   ","SDG_GOAL__GLOBAL":"   ","SDG_TARGET__GLOBAL":"   ","SDG_INDICATOR__GLOBAL":"   ","reporting_status":"notstarted"},"national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-11-17","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-11-17: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-data-canada-odd-donnees/sdg-data-donnees-odd/commit/c4b34509582f74220c9fdeb63c5c66316a25997e","indicator":"5.c.1","target_id":"5.c","sdg_goal":"5","indicator_sort_order":"05-0c-01"}
