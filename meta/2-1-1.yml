  The prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) is an estimate of the proportion of the population whose habitual food consumption is insufficient to provide the dietary energy levels that are required to maintain a normal active and healthy life. It is expressed as a percentage.
DATA_COMP: custom.data-comp
REC_USE_LIM: |-
  For each year, the observation represents the 3-year average of the previous year, the reference year, and the following year. For example, the observation for 2015 represents the 3-year average of the period 2014-2016.
  <br><br>
  Starting from 2019, estimates are based on projected values.

  Due to the limited precision of this estimate, FAO reports all values below 2.5% as "< 2.5".
