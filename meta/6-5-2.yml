SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 6.5: By 2030, implement integrated water resources management

SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 6.5.2: Proportion of transboundary basin area with an
  operational arrangement for water cooperation</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>The proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement
  for water cooperation is defined as the proportion of transboundary basins area
  within a country with an operational arrangement for water cooperation. It is derived
  by adding up the surface area in a country of those transboundary surface water
  catchments and transboundary aquifers (i.e. &#x2018;transboundary&#x2019; basins)
  that are covered by an operational arrangement and dividing the obtained area by
  the aggregate total area in a country of all transboundary basins (both catchments
  and aquifers). The result is multiplied by 100 to obtain it expressed as percentage
  share.</p>
