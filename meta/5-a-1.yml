SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls</p>'
SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 5.a: Undertake reforms to give women equal rights to economic
  resources, as well as access to ownership and control over land and other forms
  of property, financial services, inheritance and natural resources, in accordance
  with national laws</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 5.a.1: (a) Proportion of total agricultural population
  with ownership or secure rights over agricultural land, by sex; and (b) share of
  women among owners or rights-bearers of agricultural land, by type of tenure</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: 'The indicator is divided in two sub-indicators. <br><br> Sub-indicator 5.a.1 (a) is a prevalence measure. It measures the prevalence of people in the agricultural population with ownership or secure rights over agricultural land, disaggregated by sex. <br><br>
  Land ownership is a legally recognised right to acquire, to use and to transfer land. “Secure rights” in the context of indicator 5.a.1 is defined as secure tenure rights, i.e., rights to use, manage and control land, fisheries and forests, in the sense of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security. Operationally, for the purposes of measurement of this indicator, secure tenure rights comprise both land ownership and two key alienation rights: the right to sell and the right to bequeath agricultural land. <br> <br>
  Sub-indicator 5.a.1 (b) focuses on gender parity, measuring the extent to which women are disadvantaged in ownership or secure rights over agricultural land. <br> <br>
  Broad types of tenure identified by the IAEG-SDG are freehold, customary and leasehold.'
