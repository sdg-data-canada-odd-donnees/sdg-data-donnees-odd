    Target 11.2: By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for 
    all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of 
    those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons

    Indicator 11.2.1: Proportion of population that has convenient access to public transport, by sex, age and persons with disabilities

COVERAGE: Province or territory, Census subdivision, Census metropolitan area
STAT_CONC_DEF: |
  The access to public transport is considered convenient when a stop is accessible within a walking distance along the street network 
  of 500 meters from a reference point.
DATA_COMP: |
  The method used to estimate the percentage of Canadians living within 500 metres of a public transport access point was as follows: 
  1. Locations of public transport stops of all kinds (bus, trolley, surface and underground rail) were obtained from the cities' 
  websites or the local transit authorities. Complete data coverage was achieved for the municipalities constituting the 41 census 
  metropolitan areas (CMA). Other municipalities within certain agglomeration areas (CA) were included when data was available. 
  2. Public transit stop locations were integrated with Statistics Canada's 2021 Census population counts data at the blockface geographic 
  level. The proportion of population located within a service area of 500-metre walking distance (for example, convenient access) 
  from public transit stops was calculated, using the National Road Network. Based on these estimates, the population with convenient 
  access to public transport was estimated for each municipality inside CMAs and CAs. 
  3. In the final step, the total population with convenient access to public transport was divided by the total population of the 
  entire CMA to produce indicator 11.2.1, following the UN Sustainable Development Goals guidelines.

    the scope of analysis only. The analysis scope included municipalities where a regularly scheduled public transit service was
    identified.
