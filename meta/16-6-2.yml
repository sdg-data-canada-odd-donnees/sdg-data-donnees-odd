  This indicator measures levels of public satisfaction with people's last experience with public services, in the three service areas of healthcare, education and government services (i.e. services to obtain government-issued identification documents and services for the civil registration of life events such as births, marriages and deaths). This is a survey-based indicator which emphasizes citizens' <em>experiences</em> over general perceptions, with an eye on measuring the availability and quality of services <em>as they were actually delivered to survey respondents</em>.
