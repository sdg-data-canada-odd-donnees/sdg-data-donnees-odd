STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>This indicator measures levels of public satisfaction with people&#x2019;s
  last experience with public services, in the three service areas of healthcare,
  education and government services (i.e. services to obtain government-issued identification
  documents and services for the civil registration of life events such as births,
  marriages and deaths).
  This is a survey-based indicator which emphasizes citizens&#x2019; <em>experiences</em>
  over general perceptions, with an eye on measuring the availability and quality
  of services <em>as they were actually delivered to survey respondents</em>. </p>
