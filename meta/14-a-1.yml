SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources
  for sustainable development</p>'
SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 14.a: Increase scientific knowledge, develop research capacity
  and transfer marine technology, taking into account the Intergovernmental Oceanographic
  Commission Criteria and Guidelines on the Transfer of Marine Technology, in order
  to improve ocean health and to enhance the contribution of marine biodiversity to
  the development of developing countries, in particular small island developing States
  and least developed countries</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 14.a.1: Proportion of total research budget allocated
  to research in the field of marine technology</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>Definitions and mechanisms used in the development of the SDG indicator
  14.a.1 are based on the IOC Criteria and Guidelines on Transfer of Marine Technology
  &#x2013; IOCCGTMT (originally published and endorsed by IOC Member States in 2005.
  These guidelines provide an internationally agreed definition of what is understood
  by the term marine technology and have been referenced in various UN General Assembly
  Resolutions and specifically in the formulation of SDG target 14.a. These are further
  explained in the Global Ocean Science Report (GOSR) referenced below.</p>
