SDG_GOAL: 'Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote
  lifelong learning opportunities for all'
SDG_TARGET: 'Target 4.1: By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free,
  equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective
  learning outcomes'
SDG_INDICATOR: 'Indicator 4.1.2: Educational attainment of the population aged 25 to 64, by age group and sex'
STAT_CONC_DEF: '<strong>Definition:</strong><br> Percentage of a cohort of children or young people aged 3-5 years above the intended age for the last grade of each level of education who have completed that grade. <br><br><strong>Concepts:</strong><br> The intended age for the last grade of each level of education is the age at which pupils would enter the 
  grade if they had started school at the official primary entrance age, had studied full-time and had progressed without repeating or skipping a grade. For example, if the official age of entry into primary education is 6 years, and if primary education has 6 grades, the intended age for the last grade of primary education is 11 years. In this case, 14-16 years (11 + 3 = 14 and 11 + 5 = 16) would be the reference age group for calculation of the primary completion rate.'

  'High school graduation rate is calculated from Secondary 3 to Secondary 5 in Quebec, and Grades 10-12 in all other provinces.  On-time graduation rate is the percentage of a cohort of young people who complete their high school studies within three years of starting Grade 10 (“Secondary 3” in Quebec).  On-time graduation rate reflects the cohort entering Grade 10 ("Secondary 3" in Quebec) two school years prior to the reference year. For example, the data for reference year 2016/2017 represents the cohort entering Grade 10 ("Secondary 3" in Quebec) in 2014/2015. <br><br>
  High school graduation rate is calculated from Secondary 3 to Secondary 5 in Quebec, and Grades 10-12 in all other provinces. The true-cohort methodology uses two cohorts of students that begin in Grade 10 ("Secondary 3" in Quebec) to calculate the high school graduation rate (see <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/81-582-G"> <em>Indicator C3</em></a> for more details). <br><br>
  Comparisons of high school graduation rates between provinces and territories require a nuanced interpretation as academic pathways, pass marks, subject requirements and the groups of students under consideration may differ from one province or territory to another. International students are also included in the graduation cohort, which could impact comparing graduation rates, as the proportion of international students varies across provinces. <br><br>
  Graduation rates reported here may differ to what is reported at the provincial/territorial-level due to varying methodologies for the calculation of graduation rates by individual provinces and territories.'
