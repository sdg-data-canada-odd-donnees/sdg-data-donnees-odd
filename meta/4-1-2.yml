SDG_GOAL: 'Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote
  lifelong learning opportunities for all'
SDG_TARGET: 'Target 4.1: By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free,
  equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective
  learning outcomes'
SDG_INDICATOR: 'Indicator 4.1.2: Educational attainment of the population aged 25 to 64, by age group and sex'
STAT_CONC_DEF: '<strong>Definition:</strong><br> Percentage of a cohort of children or young people aged 3-5 years above the intended age for the last grade of each level of education who have completed that grade. <br><br><strong>Concepts:</strong><br> The intended age for the last grade of each level of education is the age at which pupils would enter the 
  grade if they had started school at the official primary entrance age, had studied full-time and had progressed without repeating or skipping a grade. For example, if the official age of entry into primary education is 6 years, and if primary education has 6 grades, the intended age for the last grade of primary education is 11 years. In this case, 14-16 years (11 + 3 = 14 and 11 + 5 = 16) would be the reference age group for calculation of the primary completion rate.'
