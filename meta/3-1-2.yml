  Indicator 3.1.2: Proportion of births in hospital
STAT_CONC_DEF: |-
  Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel (generally doctors, nurses or midwives but can refer to other health professionals providing childbirth care) is the proportion of childbirths attended by professional health personnel. 
  <br><br>
  According to the current definition these are competent maternal and newborn health (MNH) professionals educated, trained and regulated to national and international standards. They are competent to: (i) provide and promote evidence-based, human-rights based, quality, socio-culturally sensitive and dignified care to women and newborns; (ii) facilitate physiological processes during labour and delivery to ensure a clean and positive childbirth experience; and (iii) identify and manage or refer women and/or newborns with complications.

REC_USE_LIM: |-
  This is a proxy indicator. The UN Global indicator states: "Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel".
  <br><br>
  The proportion of births in hospital includes live births and fetal deaths (stillbirths).
  <br><br>
  Due to improvements in methodology and timeliness, the duration of data collection has been shortened compared to previous years. As a result, there may have been fewer births and stillbirths captured by the time of the release. Data for 2022 and 2023 are considered preliminary.
  <br><br>
  As a result of delays with birth and stillbirth registrations, fewer births and stillbirths have been captured, to date, for Manitoba inÂ 2022. There were also fewer births captured for Nova Scotia in 2021 due to coverage issues.
  <br><br>
  2017 to 2022 data for Yukon are not available.
