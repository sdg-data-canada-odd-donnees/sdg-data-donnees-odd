STAT_CONC_DEF: 'The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 was adopted by UN Member States in 
March 2015 as a global policy of disaster risk reduction. One of the targets is: “Substantially increase the 
number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020”.
In line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, disaster risk reduction 
strategies and policies should mainstream and integrate disaster risk reduction within and across all 
sectors, across different timescales and with targets, indicators and time frames. These strategies should be aimed at preventing the creation of disaster risk, the reduction of existing risk and the strengthening 
of economic, social, health and environmental resilience.'
