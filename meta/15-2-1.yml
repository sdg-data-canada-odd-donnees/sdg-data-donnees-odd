    <p>Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial
      ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse
      land degradation and halt biodiversity loss</p>
SDG_TARGET: >-
    <p>Target 15.2: By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management
      of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially
      increase afforestation and reforestation globally</p>
SDG_INDICATOR: >-
    <p>Indicator 15.2.1: Progress towards sustainable forest management</p>
STAT_CONC_DEF: |
  The indicator is composed of five sub-indicators that measure progress towards all dimensions of sustainable forest management. The environmental values of forests are covered by three sub-indicators focused on the extension of forest area, biomass within the forest area and protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources. Social and economic values of forests are reconciled with environmental values through sustainable management plans. The sub-indicator provides further qualification to the management of forest areas, by assessing areas which are independently verified for compliance with a set of national or international standards. <br><br>
  The sub-indicators are: <br>
  1. Annual forest area change rate <br>
  2. Above-ground biomass in forest <br>
  3. Proportion of forest area within legally established protected areas <br>
  4. Proportion of forest area under a long-term management plan <br>
  5. Forest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme
DATA_COMP: custom.data-comp
REC_USE_LIM: 'Forest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme is measured in millions of hectares rather than thousands as specified in the metadata.'
