SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 12.2.1: Material Footprint, material footprint per capita,
  and material footprint per GDP</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>Material Footprint (MF) is the attribution of global material extraction
  to domestic final demand of a country. The total material footprint is the sum of
  the material footprint for biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and non-metal ores.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  Data were tabulated to report to this indicator as specified by the metadata. Please refer to the sources to access additional information on the metadata or source.
  <br><br>
  Material footprint (MF) = Domestic extraction of materials + raw material equivalent of imports - raw material equivalent of exports
  <br><br>
  MF per capita = DMC/Total population
  <br><br>
  DMC per GDP = DMC/GDP in chained 2017 dollars
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  The series <i>Material footprint per GDP</i> is reported in tonnes per chained 2017 canadian dollars, as opposed to "Kilograms per constant United States dollar" as per the official metadata.
