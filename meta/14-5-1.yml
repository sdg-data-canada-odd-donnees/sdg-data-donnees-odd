SDG_GOAL: 'Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources
  for sustainable development'
SDG_TARGET: 'Target 14.5: By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and
  marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best
  available scientific information'
SDG_INDICATOR: 'Indicator 14.5.1: Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine
  areas'
STAT_CONC_DEF: >-
  This indicator measures the proportion of Canada's marine area that is conserved. 
  Conserved areas are lands and waters where human use is limited. They include protected 
  areas as well as other effective area-based conservation measures. <em>Environment and 
  Climate Change Canada (ECCC)</em>
DATA_COMP: >-
  The area conserved is estimated by means of a geographical analysis based on reported 
  boundaries, accounting for overlaps. <em>(ECCC)</em>
  <br><br>
  Data were readily available to report to this indicator as specified by the metadata. 
  Please refer to the sources to access additional information on the metadata or source.
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  Land and/or water access and use within protected areas are controlled primarily for the 
  purpose of conserving nature (for example, a park, a conservation area or a wildlife 
  reserve). Other effective area-based conservation measures are also managed over the long 
  term in ways that result in the effective conservation of biodiversity. However, they 
  might have been established for other purposes. 
  <br><br>
  Trends are estimated based on the date a site was established, rather than the date when it 
  was recognized as a Protected Area or other effective area-based conservation measure (OECM). 
  As such, the totals for a previous year may change as data are updated.
  <br><br>
  Comparisons with previous reports should be made with caution, as data quality and 
  completeness continue to improve. Privately protected land and other effective area-based 
  conservation measures contribute to achievement of Canada's targets, but many are not yet 
  captured within the database. <em>(ECCC)</em>
