SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources
  for sustainable development</p>'
SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 14.5: By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and
  marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best
  available scientific information</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 14.5.1: Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine
  areas</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>The indicator Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine
  areas shows temporal trends in the mean percentage of each important site for marine
  biodiversity (i.e., those that contribute significantly to the global persistence
  of biodiversity) that is covered by designated protected areas and Other Effective
  Area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs).</p>
DATA_COMP: 'The area conserved is estimated by means of a geographical analysis based on reported boundaries, accounting for overlaps. <em>(ECCC)</em>'
REC_USE_LIM: "<p>Land and/or water access and use within protected areas are controlled primarily for the purpose of conserving nature 
    (for example, a park, a conservation area or a wildlife reserve). Other effective area-based conservation measures are also managed 
    over the long term in ways that result in the effective conservation of biodiversity. However, they might have been established for other purposes. 
    <br><br>Trends are estimated based on the date a site was established, rather than the date when it was recognized as a Protected Area or other 
    effective area-based conservation measure (OECM). As such, the totals for a previous year may change as data are updated. <br><br>Comparisons with 
    previous reports should be made with caution, as data quality and completeness continue to improve. Privately protected land and other effective 
    area-based conservation measures contribute to achievement of Canada's targets, but many are not yet captured within the database.
