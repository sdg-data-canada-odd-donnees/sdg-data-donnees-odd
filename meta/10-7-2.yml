  policies and how such policies change over time. The information collected seeks
  to identify both progress made and gaps, thus contributing to the evidence base
  for actionable recommendations for the implementation of SDG target 10.7. The indicator
  also serves for the future thematic reviews at the High-level Political Forum on
  Sustainable Development (HLPF). </p>
