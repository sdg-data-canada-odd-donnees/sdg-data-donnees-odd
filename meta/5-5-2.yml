SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator: 5.5.2: Proportion of women in managerial positions</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: '<p>This indicator refers to the proportion of females in the total
  number of persons employed in managerial positions. It is recommended to use two
  different measures jointly for this indicator: the share of females in (total) management
  and the share of females in senior and middle management (thus excluding junior
  management). The joint calculation of these two measures provides information on
  whether women are more represented in junior management than in senior and middle
  management, thus pointing to an eventual ceiling for women to access higher-level
  management positions. In these cases, calculating only the share of women in (total)
  management would be misleading, in that it would suggest that women hold positions
  with more decision-making power and responsibilities than they actually do.</p>'
