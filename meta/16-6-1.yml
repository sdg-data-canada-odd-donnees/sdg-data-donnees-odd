REC_USE_LIM: |
    <p>Actual expenditure outturns can significantly deviate from the originally approved budget for reasons unrelated to the accuracy of forecasts, for example, as a result of a major macroeconomic shock.</p><p>The Public Accounts expenditures are cash-based and presented of a net basis (gross expenditures less revenues netted against expenditures). Federal (and provincial-territorial) budget estimates and public accounts are produced based on a fiscal year basis, ending March 31st.  For reporting purposes in the Statistics Canada' SDGs data hub, figures will be presented as if the end of fiscal year would be December 31st. For example, the year 2016 corresponds to the figures reported in the 2016-17  Public Accounts, since 2016 would cover 3 ouf of 4 quarters for the fiscal year 2016-17.</p>
