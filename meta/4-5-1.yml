## NATIONAL METADATA
SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote
  lifelong learning opportunities for all</p>'
SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 4.5: By 2030, eliminate gender disparities in education and
  ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable,
  including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in vulnerable
  situations</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 4.5.1: Parity indices (female/male, rural/urban, bottom/top
  wealth quintile and others such as disability status, indigenous peoples and conflict-affected,
  as data become available) for all education indicators on this list that can be
  disaggregated</p>'

    <p>The parity index is the main method chosen by the international community to measure equity across the Goal 4 indicators, and is defined by the ratio between the values of a given indicator for two different groups. An index between 0.97 and 1.03 indicates a parity between the two groups. A value that is less than 0.97 or greater than 1.03 indicates an inequity between the two groups.</p>
    <p><b>Gender Parity Index (GPI):</b> is the ratio between the values of a given indicator of males and females. This is calculated by dividing the female value of an indicator by the male value of the same indicator. It is the main method chosen by the international community, such as UNESCO, to measure equity across the SDG-4 indicators. A GPI between 0.97 and 1.03 indicates parity between females and males. A value less than 0.97 indicates a disparity in favour of boys and a value more than 1.03 indicates a disparity in favour of girls.</p>
    <p><b>Location Parity Index:</b> measures progress towards parity in education participation and/or learning opportunities available for children, adolescents or youth living in rural areas in relation to those living in urban areas. This is calculated by dividing the rural value of an indicator by the urban value of the same indicator. It is the main method chosen by the international community, such as UNESCO, to measure equity across the SDG-4 indicators. A location parity index between 0.97 and 1.03 indicates parity between those living in urban and rural locations. A value less than 0.97 indicates a disparity in favour of those living in urban locations and a value more than 1.03 indicates a disparity in favour of those living in rural locations.</p>
    <p><b>Economic, Social and Cultural Status (ESCS) Index:</b> was created on the basis of the following variables: 1) the International-Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI); 2) the highest level of education of the student's parents, converted into years of schooling; 3) the PISA index of family wealth; 4) the PISA index of home educational resources and 5) the PISA index of possessions related to "classical" culture in the family home. This is calculated by dividing the bottom quartile of the ESCS index by the top quartile of the ESCS index of the same indicator. An ESCS index between 0.97 and 1.03 indicates parity between those children from the bottom quartile of the ESCS index and those from the top ESCS quartile. A value less than 0.97 indicates a disparity in favour of children from the top quartile of the ESCS index and a value more than 1.03 indicates a disparity in favour of those from the bottom quartile of the ESCS index.</p>
    <p><b>Parental Educational Attainment Index:</b> measures progress towards parity in education participation and/or learning opportunities available for children, adolescents and adults based on their parents educational attainment and indicates that at least one parent has attained a tertiary degree (ISCED 2011 levels 5, 6, 7 and 8). This is calculated by dividing the number of students who do not have at least one parent with a tertiary education by the number of students with at least one parent with a tertiary education. A parental educational attainment parity index between 0.97 and 1.03 indicates parity between those whose parent(s) have below a tertiary education and those who have attained at least a tertiary education. A value less than 0.97 indicates a disparity in favour of those whose parent(s) have attained a tertiary education or above and a value more than 1.03 indicates a disparity in favour of those whose parent(s) have attained less than a tertiary education.</p>

REC_USE_LIM: |
    The territories did not participate in PISA 2015, and as a result are not represented in some indicators.
