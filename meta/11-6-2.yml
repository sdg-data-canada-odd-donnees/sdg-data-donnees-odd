  [Fine particulate matter](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-pollution/pollutants/common-contaminants/particulate-matter.html) (PM2.5) is emitted directly to the air and can also be formed in the air through the interactions of other pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, ammonia and volatile organic compounds. PM2.5 is one of the major components of smog and one of the most widespread outdoor pollutants. (Environment and Climate Change Canada)
