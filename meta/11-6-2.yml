STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>The mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less
  than 2.5 microns in diameters (PM2.5) is a common measure of air pollution. The
  mean is a population-weighted average for urban population in a country, and is
  expressed in micrograms per cubic meter [&#xF06D;g/m<sup>3</sup>].</p>
