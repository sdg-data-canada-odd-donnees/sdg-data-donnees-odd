  to promote the development, transfer, dissemination and diffusion of environmentally
  sound technologies</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: |
  The purpose of this indicator is to develop a methodology for tracking the total amount of approved 
  funding to promote the development, transfer, dissemination and diffusion of environmentally sound 
  technologies. A two-pronged approach is suggested:
  <br>- Level 1. Use globally available data to create a proxy of funding flowing to countries for 
  environmentally sound technologies, or of trade in environmentally sound technologies 
  <br>- Level 2. Collect national data on investment in environmentally sound technologies
