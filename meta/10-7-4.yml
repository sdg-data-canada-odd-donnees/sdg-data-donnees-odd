#  Refugees refers to persons recognized by the Government and/or UNHCR, those in a refugee-like situation and other persons in need of international protection. Refugees includes immigrants who were granted permanent resident status on the basis of a well-founded fear of returning to their home country. This category includes persons who had a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in particular social group or for political opinion (Geneva Convention refugees) as well as persons who had been seriously and personally affected by civil war or armed conflict, or have suffered a massive violation of human rights. Some refugees were in Canada when they applied for refugee protection for themselves and their family members (either with them in Canada or abroad). Others were abroad and were referred for resettlement to Canada by the United Nations Refugee Agency, another designated referral organization or private sponsors.

REC_USE_LIM: >-
#  Data on the number of refugees by country of origin at mid-year are collected in May during each census, rather than on July 1st annually.
