STAT_CONC_DEF: |
  The indicator includes 14.1.1a Index of coastal eutrophication (ICEP) and 14.1.1b Plastic debris density. SDG 14.1.1a and SDG 14.1.1b will described
  as two indicators. Across the 14.1.1a and 14.1.1b, two mandatory levels are proposed: Level 1: Global Data Products (globally available data from earth 
  observations and modelling), Level 2: National Data, which are collected from countries (through the relevant Regional Seas Programme for countries that 
  are member of a Regional Seas Programme, or directly by UNEP).
