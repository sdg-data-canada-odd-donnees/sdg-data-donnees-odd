SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 4.1.1: Proportion of children and young people (a) in Grade 4; and (c) aged 15 years achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics, by sex</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: 'Percentage of children and young people achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and 
  (ii) mathematics during primary education (Grade 4) and at the end 
  of lower secondary education (15 years old). The minimum proficiency level will be measured relative to new common 
  reading and mathematics scales currently in development.'

  This is a proxy indicator. The UN Global indicator states: Proportion of children and young people:
  (a) in grades 2/3; (b) at the end of primary; education and (c) at the end of lower
  secondary education achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading
  and (ii) mathematics, by sex".
  <br>
  <br> Series (a): Data for this series are reported for Grade 4, rather than Grade 2 or 3 as specified by the UN metadata.
  <br>
  <br> Series (b): Data on indicator series (b) are not available for Canada.
  <br>
  <br> Series (c): Data for this series are reported for young people aged 15 years, rather than at the end of lower secondary education as specified by the UN metadata.
  <br>
  <br> The data for Canada obtained from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) includes only the provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, Ontario, and Quebec.
