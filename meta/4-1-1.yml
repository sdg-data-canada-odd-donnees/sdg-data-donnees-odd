SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote
  lifelong learning opportunities for all</p>'
SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 4.1: By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free,
  equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective
  learning outcomes</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 4.1.1: Proportion of children and young people (b) in Grade 4; and (c) aged 15 years achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: 'Percentage of children and young people achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and 
  (ii) mathematics during primary education (Grade 4) and at the end 
  of lower secondary education (15 years old). The minimum proficiency level will be measured relative to new common 
  reading and mathematics scales currently in development.'
DATA_COMP: |
  Data were readily available to report on this indicator as specified by the metadata. Please refer to the sources to access additional information on the metadata or source. 
  <br>
  <br> Data for the series "Children in Grade 4 achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in mathematics" can be accessed at the following sources: Source 2, Source 3, and Source 4 in the Sources tab. Data for all other series can be accessed at Source 1.
  <br>
  <br> Data for the year 2015 for the series "Children in Grade 4 achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in mathematics" is derived by aggregating the percentages ranging from the Intermediate benchmark to the Advanced benchmark.
REC_USE_LIM: |
  This is a proxy indicator. The UN Global indicator states: Proportion of children and young people:
  (a) in grades 2/3; (b) at the end of primary; education and (c) at the end of lower
  secondary education achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading
  and (ii) mathematics, by sex".
  <br>
  <br> Series (a): Data are not available for Canada.
  <br>
  <br> Series (b): Data for this series are reported for TIMSS/PIRLS Grade 4, which are mapped to the end of primary when primary lasts six or less years, as specified by the UN metadata. 
  <br>
  <br> Series (c): Data for this series are reported for young people aged 15 years, rather than at the end of lower secondary education as specified by the UN metadata.
  <br>
  <br> The data for Canada obtained from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) includes only the provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, Ontario, and Quebec.
