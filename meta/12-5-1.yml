SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 12.5.1: National recycling rate, tons of material recycled</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>For the purposes of this indicator, the National Recycling Rate
  will be defined as the quantity of material recycled in the country plus quantities
  exported for recycling out of total waste generated in the country, minus material
  imported intended for recycling. Note that recycling includes codigestion/anaerobic
  digestion and composting/aerobic process, but not controlled combustion (incineration)
  or land application.</p>
