SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns</p>'
SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 12.5: By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through
  prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 12.5.1: Total waste diversion per capita</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: |-
  This indicator measures the amount of waste diverted per capita.
DATA_COMP: |-
  Waste diversion per capita = Total kilograms of waste diverted from disposal / Total population
  <br><br>
  Non-residential sources include solid non-hazardous recyclable
  material from the Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional sector as well as the
  Construction, Renovation and Demolition sector. Materials are those generated by
  all IC and I and CRD sources in a municipality, and are excluded from the residential
  waste stream. 
  <br><br>
  Residential non-hazardous recyclable materials include solid
  non-hazardous materials produced in all residences and include non-hazardous materials
  that are picked up by the municipality and non-hazardous materials from residential
  sources that are self-hauled to depots, transfer stations and disposal facilities.
REC_USE_LIM: |-
  This is a proxy indicator. The UN Global indicator states: “National recycling rate, tons of material recycled”.
  <br><br>
  This information covers only those companies and local waste
  management organizations that reported non-hazardous recyclable material preparation
  activities and refers only to that material entering the waste stream and does not
  cover any waste that may be managed on-site by a company or household. <br><br>Additionally,
  these data do not include those materials transported by the generator directly
  to secondary processors, such as pulp and paper mills, while bypassing entirely
  any firm or local government involved in waste management activities. Residential
  and non-residential splits are not available at the total level, as electronic and
  tire source data are unavailable.
  <br><br>
  Data presented here accounts for material brought to sorting or processing facilities. 
  As some of this material is deemed unrecyclable during sorting, not all of it ends up being recycled or composted.
