SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 12.5.1: National recycling rate, tons of material recycled</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>For the purposes of this indicator, the National Recycling Rate
  will be defined as the quantity of material recycled in the country plus quantities
  exported for recycling out of total waste generated in the country, minus material

  digestion and composting/aerobic process, but not controlled combustion (incineration)
  or land application.</p>
