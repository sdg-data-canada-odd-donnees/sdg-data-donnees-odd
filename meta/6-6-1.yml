  Indicator 6.6.1: Change in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time
STAT_CONC_DEF: |-
  SDG indicator 6.6.1 tracks the extent to which different types of water-related ecosystems are changing in extent over time. The indicator is multifaceted capturing data on different types of freshwater ecosystems and to measure extent change the indicator considers spatial area changes, water quality and water quantity changes. The indicator uses satellite-based Earth observations to globally monitor different freshwater ecosystems types.

# Indicator 6.6.1 tracks the extent to which different types of water-related
# ecosystems are changing in extent over time. The indicator is multifaceted capturing
# data on different types of freshwater ecosystems and to measure extent change the
# indicator considers spatial area changes, water quality and water quantity changes.
# The indicator uses satellite based Earth observations to globally monitor different
# freshwater ecosystems types Earth observation data series on surface area are available
# on permanent water, seasonal water, reservoirs, wetlands, mangroves; as well as
# generating data on water quality the using trophic state and turbidity of water
# bodies. Satellite images can be represented as numerical data, which in turn are
# aggregated into meaningful statistics of ecosystem change attributed to administrative
# areas such as national, sub-national (e.g. regions and provinces) and river basin
# boundaries. Global data products for river flows and groundwater level have not
# yet been produced at useful spatial and temporal resolutions to be incorporated
# into this SDG 6.6.1 methodology. Currently, these data should continue to be provided
# from modelling or from ground-based measurements and required from the countries.
# <br>
# <br><b>Extent</b> - As used in the title of this indicator, 'extent' is expanded beyond spatial extent
# to capture additional basic parameters needed for the protection and restoration of water-related
# ecosystems. Extent includes three components - the spatial extent or surface area, the quality, 
# and the quantity of water-related ecosystems.
# <br>
# <br><b>Surface Water</b> refers to any area of surface water unobstructed by aquatic vegetation. This includes the 
# following 3 water-related ecosystem categories: rivers and estuaries, lakes, and artificial waterbodies.
# <br>
# <br><b>Reservoirs</b> are artificial (or human-made) bodies of freshwater, as opposed to lakes which are naturally 
# occurring. The reservoirs dataset represents surface area data on artificial water bodies including reservoirs 
# formed by dams, flooded areas such as opencast mines and quarries, flood irrigation areas, and water 
# bodies created by hydro-engineering projects such as waterway and harbour construction.
# <br>
# <br><b>Maximum water extent dynamics</b> is an intra-annual measurement corresponding to the highest observed (or 
# maximum) extent a reservoir reaches within a year. The data shows the extent to which the annual maximum surface area 
# of reservoirs has changed compared to a reference period. This change is calculated by comparing the maximum area of 
# the most recent five years against a five year reference period (2000-2004).
# <br>
# <br><b>Minimum water extent dynamics</b> is the lowest observed (or minimum) surface area of reservoirs in a year 
# (intra-annual measurement). This minimum extent varies from one year to another. The data shows the extent to which the 
# annual minimum surface area of reservoirs has changed compared to a reference period. This change is calculated by 
# comparing the minimum extent of the most recent five years against a five year reference period (2000-2004).
# <br>
# <br><b>Turbidity</b> is an indicator of water clarity, quantifying the haziness of the water and acting as an indicator of 
# underwater light availability. <b>Trophic State</b> refers to the degree at which organic matter accumulates in the water body and is most 
# commonly used in relation to monitoring eutrophication. Both water parameters may be used to infer a particular state, or quality, of a 
# freshwater body.
# <br>
# <br><b>Turbidity state</b> and <b>trophic state</b> show the total percentage deviation, from a baseline. A five year baseline (2006-2010), 
# per lake, has been produced for both parameters. This is used to measure change against recent years (2017-2019). The data represent the 
# number of lakes impacted by a degradation of their environmental conditions (i.e. showing a deviation in turbidity and trophic state from 
# the baseline) compared to the total number of lakes within a country. The values produced account for different sized lakes.
# <br>
# <br><b>Change</b> means a shift from one condition of extent to another over time within a water-related ecosystem, 
# measured against a point of reference. Surface-water extent changes are compared against a 20-year reference 
# period (baseline).
# <br>
# <br><b>Permanent water</b> is defined as being present all 12 months per year.
# <br>
# <br><b>Seasonal water</b> is defined as being present less than 12 months per year.
# <br>
# <br><b>New water</b>is an area of land that has transitioned to water.
# <br>
# <br><b>Lost water</b> is an area of water that has transitioned to land.
