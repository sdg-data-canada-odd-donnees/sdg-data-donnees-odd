    "Total Human Trafficking" is comprised of two violation codes, 1525 "Trafficking in Persons" (S.279.01, 279.011, 279.02, 279.03 of the Criminal Code) and 6510 "Human Trafficking" from S.117 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.<br><br>
    Human trafficking incidents reported to the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Survey may be undercounted due to differences in police reporting practices for this violation. <br><br>
    This is a proxy indicator measuring the number of human trafficking incidents reported rather than the number of victims of human trafficking as specified by the metadata.
