  The proportion of domestic budget funded by domestic taxes is calculated for the consolidated Canadian general government as the proportion of total taxes relative to the total expenditure, expressed as a percentage.
  <br><br>
  Expenditures financed by taxes (%) = (Total taxes / Total expenditure) Ã— 100
  <br><br>
  Total expenditure is defined as the sum of total current expenditures and total capital expenditures. Total current expenditures include all expenses, less consumption of fixed capital, plus consumption of fixed capital according to public sector accounts and capitalized research and development costs. Total capital expenditure is the difference in nonfinancial assets according to public sector accounts between the current year and the previous year.
  <br><br>
  Total expenditure = Total current expenditure + Total capital expenditure
  <br><br>
  Total current expenditure = Expenses - Consumption of fixed capital + Consumption of fixed capital according to public sector accounts + Capitalized research and development costs
  <br><br>
  Total capital expenditure = Nonfinancial assets according to public sector accounts (current year) - Nonfinancial assets according to public sector accounts (previous year)
