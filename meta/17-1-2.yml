SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 17.1: Strengthen domestic resource mobilization, including

SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 17.1.2: Proportion of domestic budget funded by domestic
  taxes</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>The precise definition of the indicator is the Proportion of domestic
  budgetary central government expenditure funded by taxes. Budgetary central government,
  described in GFSM 2014 (paragraph 2.81) is an institutional unit of the general
  government sector particularly important in terms of size and power, particularly
  the power to exercise control over many other units and entities. The budgetary
  central government is often a single unit of the central government that encompasses
  the fundamental activities of the national executive, legislative, and judiciary
  powers. This component of general government is usually covered by the main (or
  general) budget. The budgetary central government&#x2019;s revenue (and expense)
  are normally regulated and controlled by a ministry of finance, or its functional
  equivalent, by means of a budget approved by the legislature. Most of the ministries,
  departments, agencies, boards, commissions, judicial authorities, legislative bodies,
  and other entities that make up the budgetary central government are not separate
  institutional units. This is because they generally do not have the authority to
  own assets, incur liabilities, or engage in transactions in their own right (see
  GFSM 2014 paragraph 2.42). including references to standards and classifications,
  preferably relying on international agreed definitions. The indicator definition
  should be unambiguous and expressed in universally applicable terms. It must clearly
  express the unit of measurement (proportion, dollars, number of people, etc.).</p>
