SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 14.2: By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal 
  ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, 
  and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 14.2.1: Number of countries using ecosystem-based approaches
  to managing marine areas</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>Regional Seas Coordinated Indicator 22 &#x2018;Integrated Coastal
  Zone Management (ICZM) is proposed as the primary indicator. For countries with
  Marine/Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) in place, these plans can be helpful to assess
  ICZM. For other countries, it is important to identify ways to measure existing
  plans and to build capacity for integrated planning. All data for this indicator
  will be based on country submissions to the Regional Seas Programme. </p>
