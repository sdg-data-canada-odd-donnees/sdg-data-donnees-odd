  This is a proxy indicator. Due to data limitations, this indicator measures the mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease per 100,000 persons rather than the probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes
  or chronic respiratory diseases as specified in the metadata.
