SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial
  ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse
  land degradation and halt biodiversity loss</p>'
SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 15.4: By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems,
  including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits

SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 15.4.1: Coverage by protected areas of important sites
  for mountain biodiversity</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: |
  The indicator "Coverage by protected areas of important sites for
  mountain biodiversity" shows temporal trends in the mean percentage of each important
  site for mountain biodiversity (i.e., those that contribute significantly to the
  global persistence of biodiversity) that is covered by designated protected areas
  and Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs). 
  <br><br>
  <b>Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs)</b> are sites that contribute significantly to the global 
  persistence of biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. They are 
  identified through national processes by local stakeholders using a set of globally 
  agreed scientific criteria.
