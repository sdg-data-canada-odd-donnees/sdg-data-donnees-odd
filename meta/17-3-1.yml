STAT_CONC_DEF: |
  This indicator measures Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Official Development
  Assistance (ODA) as a proportion of Gross National Income (GNI).
  <br><br>
  Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a category of investment that reflects
  the objective of establishing a lasting interest by a resident enterprise in
  one economy (direct investor) in an enterprise (direct investment enterprise)
  that is resident in an economy other than that of the direct investor. The
  lasting interest implies the existence of a long-term relationship between the
  direct investor and the direct investment enterprise and a significant degree
  of influence on the management of the enterprise. The direct or indirect
  ownership of 10% or more of the voting power of an enterprise resident in one
  economy by an investor resident in another economy is taken as evidence of
  such a relationship.
  <br><br>
  The Development Assistance Committee (DAC) defines Official Development Assistance (ODA) as â€œthose flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are <br><br>
  i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and <br>
  ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent).
