  Indicator 17.15.1: Canada's results frameworks and planning tools by providers of development cooperation
STAT_CONC_DEF: |
  <p>This indicator measures the extent to which, and the ways in which,
  all concerned development partners use country-owned results frameworks (CRFs) to
  plan development cooperation efforts and assess their performance.</p>
  <p>Country-owned results frameworks (CRFs) define a country’s approach to results and its associated monitoring and evaluation systems focusing on performance and achievement of development results. Using a minimal definition, these results frameworks include agreed objectives and results indicators (i.e. output, outcome, and/or impact). They also set targets to measure progress in achieving the objectives defined in the government’s planning documents.</p>
