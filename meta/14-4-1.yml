SDG_GOAL: 'Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development'
SDG_TARGET: >-
  Target 14.4: By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics
SDG_INDICATOR: 'Indicator 14.4.1: Proportion of fish stocks within biologically
  sustainable levels'
STAT_CONC_DEF: >-
  The indicator compares harvest rates with established harvest limits. These limits are based on scientific information, providing a direct measure of whether we are managing the use of these resources within ecosystem limits. It is one measure of fishing pressure on wild fish stocks. <em>Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)</em>
DATA_COMP: >-
  The indicator compares harvest rates with harvest limits. These limits are based on scientific information and provide a direct measure of whether we are managing the use of these resources within ecosystem limits. <br><br>
  The indicator is a simple tabulation of stocks based on whether harvest levels are within
  removal reference levels, within other harvest limits, or over harvest limits. <em>(ECCC)</em>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  Overharvest in a single year does not mean that a stock is harvested unsustainably. Rather, it leads to a management response. Stocks managed through quotas, for example, are subject to quota reconciliation, meaning that any overharvest of a stock in one year is deducted from the harvest limit established for the following year.
  <br><br>
  The [Sustainability Survey for Fisheries](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/reports-rapports/regs/sff-cpd/survey-sondage/index-en.html) is completed with the best available information. Since the oceans are wide and deep, and fish move between habitats, their populations are difficult to monitor.
  <br><br>
  The survey summarizes information across a wide variety of species, management regimes, types of fisheries, geographic regions, and socio-economic contexts. Small changes in the set of surveyed stocks occur due to changes in the way stocks are assessed or managed. Results should be interpreted with this in mind.
  <br><br>
  The indicator does not account for fished stocks that do not meet the criteria for major stocks. Seaweeds and other aquatic plants are also excluded. <em>(ECCC)</em>
