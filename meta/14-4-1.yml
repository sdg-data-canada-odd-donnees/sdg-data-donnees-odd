SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources

SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 14.4: By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing,
  illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and
  implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the
  shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable
  yield as determined by their biological characteristics</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 14.4.1: Proportion of fish stocks within biologically
  sustainable levels</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>The indicator, Proportion of marine fish stocks within biologically
  sustainable levels, measures the sustainability of the world&apos;s marine capture
  fisheries by their abundance. A fish stock whose abundance is at or greater than
  the level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as
  biologically sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY level,
  the stock is considered biologically unsustainable. </p>
