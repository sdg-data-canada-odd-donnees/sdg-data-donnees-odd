  Personal remittances comprise of personal transfers and compensation of employees. Personal transfers 
  consist of all current transfers in cash or in kind made or received by resident households to or from non-resident households. Personal transfers thus include all current transfers between resident and non-resident individuals. Compensation of employees refers to the income of border, seasonal, and other 
  short-term workers who are employed in an economy where they are not resident and of residents 
  employed by non-resident entities. Data are the sum of two items defined in the sixth edition of the <em>International Monetary Fund's Balance of Payments Manual: personal transfers and compensation of employees</em>.
