STAT_CONC_DEF: 'Indicator 4.7.1/12.8.1/13.3.1 measures the extent to which countries mainstream Global Citizenship 
  Education (GCED) and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in their education systems. This is an 
  indicator of characteristics of different aspects of education systems: education policies, curricula, teacher 
  training and student assessment as reported by government officials, ideally following consultation with 
  other government ministries, national human rights institutes, the education sector and civil society organizations. It measures what governments intend and not what is implemented in practice in schools 
  and classrooms.'
