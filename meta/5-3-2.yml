  The official indicator name refers to &#x2018;female genital mutilation/cutting&#x2019;,
  or FGM/C. In recent years the convention within UNICEF and partner organizations
  has shifted to referring to &#x2018;female genital mutilation&#x2019;, or FGM, a
  term which is now used interchangeably with FGM/C throughout the metadata. Other
  common terms for the practice include &#x2018;female circumcision&#x2019; and &#x2018;excision&#x2019;.
  The custodian will request the IAEG-SDGs to consider a refinement of the indicator
  name to reflect this change for consideration at the UN Statistical Commission in
  2022. <a href="#footnote-ref-2">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>'
