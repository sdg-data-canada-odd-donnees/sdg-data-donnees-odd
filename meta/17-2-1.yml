SDG_TARGET: >-
    <p>Target 17.2: Developed countries to implement fully their official
      development assistance commitments, including the commitment by many developed countries
      to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income for official development
      assistance (ODA/GNI) to developing countries and 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI
      to least developed countries; ODA providers are encouraged to consider setting a
      target to provide at least 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to least developed countries</p>

    <p>Indicator 17.2.1: Net official development assistance, total and

      <strong>Definition:</strong><br>
      The indicator Net official development assistance, total and to
      least developed countries, as a proportion of the Organization for Economic Cooperation
      and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee donors&apos; gross national
      income (GNI)is defined as Net ODA disbursements as a per cent of GNI.

      <strong>Concepts</strong> <br>ODA: The DAC defines ODA as â€œthose flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are<br>
      <p>i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and</p>
      <p>ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent). (See http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm)</p> <br>
      <p>Other official flows (OOF): Other official flows (excluding officially supported export credits) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional. (See http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCDDAC(2016)3FINAL.pdf, Para 24).</p> <br>
      <p>The agriculture sector is as defined by the DAC and comprises all CRS sector codes in the 311 series (see here: http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm)
