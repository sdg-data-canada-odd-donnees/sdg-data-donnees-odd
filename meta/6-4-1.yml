STAT_CONC_DEF: 'Change in water use efficiency over time (CWUE): The change in the ratio of the value added to the volume of water use, over time. <br> <br> Water Use Efficiency (WUE) is defined as the value added of a given major sector divided by the volume
  of water used. <br> <br> Following the United Nations International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities ISIC 4 coding, sectors are defined as: <br>
  1. agriculture; forestry; fishing (ISIC A), hereinafter “agriculture”; <br>
  2. mining and quarrying; manufacturing; electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply; constructions (ISIC B, C, D and F), hereinafter “MIMEC”; <br>
  3. all the service sectors (ISIC E and ISIC G-T), hereinafter “services'
DATA_COMP: Data are from the UN Water database. Select Country=Canada, under Indicator to display, click on "Water availability and use", then on 6.4.1 Change in water-use efficiency over time. <br><br> Change in water use efficiency (CWUE) (in %) = [(WUE in time t - WUE in time t-1)/(WUE in time t-1)]*100
