  Indicator 6.4.1: Change in water-use efficiency over time
STAT_CONC_DEF: >-
  <p>Change in water use efficiency over time (CWUE): The change in the ratio of the value added to the volume of water use, over time. 
  <br><br>
  Water-use efficiency measured as the ratio of dollar value added to the volume of water used. It considers water use by all economic activities, with a focus on agriculture, industry and the service sectors.
  <br><br>
  Following the United Nations International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities ISIC 4 coding, sectors are defined as:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>agriculture; forestry; fishing (ISIC A), hereinafter “agriculture”;</li>
  <li>mining and quarrying; manufacturing; electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply; constructions (ISIC B, C, D and F), hereinafter “MIMEC”;</li>
  <li>all the service sectors (ISIC E and ISIC G-T), hereinafter “services”.</li>
  </ol>
