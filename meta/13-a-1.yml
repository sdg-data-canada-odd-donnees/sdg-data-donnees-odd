  Target 13.a: Implement the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund through its capitalization as soon as possible
SDG_INDICATOR: |-
  Indicator 13.a.1: Amounts provided and mobilized in United States dollars per year in relation to the continued existing collective mobilization goal of the $100 billion commitment through to 2025
STAT_CONC_DEF: |-
  Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process, the Code of Conduct (COP) requested the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) to prepare a Biennial Assessment and Overview of Climate Finance Flows (BA) (<a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2011/cop17/eng/09a01.pdf#page=4">decision 2/CP.17</a> paragraph 121(f)), drawing on the available sources of information, and including information on the geographical and thematic balance of flows. There is no agreed definition under the UNFCCC on what should count toward assessing progress toward the $100 billion commitment. 
  <br><br>
  Data from the UNFCCC secretariat refers to climate-specific financial support to developing country Parties, reported by Annex I Parties in their Biennial Reports. Only Annex II Parties are obligated to report on financial support provided and other Annex I Parties also voluntarily provide this information. Consequently, this data should not be interpreted as an indicator in relation to the achievement of the collective mobilization goal of $100 billion commitment.
  <br><br>
  Climate-specific financial support can be classified into three categories:
  <br>
  - Mitigation: Financial support is classified as climate change mitigation 'if it contributes to the objective of stabilisation of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous 
  anthropogenic interference with the climate system by promoting efforts to reduce or limit GHG emissions or to enhance GHG sequestration'. (OECD-DAC Rio Markers for Climate - Handbook).
  <br>
  - Adaptation: Financial support is classified as climate change adaptation 'if it intends to reduce  the vulnerability of human or natural systems to the current and expected impacts of climate change, including climate variability, 
  by maintaining or increasing resilience, through increased ability to adapt to, or absorb, climate change stresses, shocks and variability and/or by helping reduce exposure to them'. (OECD-DAC Rio Markers for Climate - Handbook).
  <br>
  - Cross-cutting: Financial support is classified as cross-cutting if it contributes to both climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives.
