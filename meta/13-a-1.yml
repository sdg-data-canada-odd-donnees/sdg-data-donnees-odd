STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>Under the UNFCCC process, the COP requested the Standing Committee
  on Finance (SCF) to prepare a Biennial Assessment and Overview of Climate Finance
  Flows (BA) (<a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2011/cop17/eng/09a01.pdf#page=4"
  target="_blank">decision 2/CP.17</a> paragraph 121(f)), drawing on the available
  sources of information, and including information on the geographical and thematic
  balance of flows. There is no agreed definition under the UNFCCC on what should
  count toward assessing progress toward the $100 billion commitment. Data from the
  UNFCCC secretariat refers to climate-specific financial support to developing country
  Parties, reported by Annex I Parties in their Biennial Reports. Only Annex II Parties
  are obligated to report on financial support provided and other Annex I Parties
  also voluntarily provide this information. Consequently, this data should not be
  interpreted as an indicator in relation to the achievement of the collective mobilization
  goal of $100 billion commitment. </p>
