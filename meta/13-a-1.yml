SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts<p> Acknowledging that the United
  Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the primary international, intergovernmental
  forum for negotiating the global response to climate change.'
SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 13.a: Implement the commitment undertaken by developed-country
  parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to a goal of
  mobilizing jointly $100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the
  needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and
  transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund through
  its capitalization as soon as possible</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 13.a.1: Amounts provided and mobilized in United States
  dollars per year in relation to the continued existing collective mobilization goal
  of the $100 billion commitment through to 2025</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process, the Code of Conduct (COP) requested the Standing Committee
  on Finance (SCF) to prepare a Biennial Assessment and Overview of Climate Finance
  Flows (BA) (<a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2011/cop17/eng/09a01.pdf#page=4"
  target="_blank">decision 2/CP.17</a> paragraph 121(f)), drawing on the available
  sources of information, and including information on the geographical and thematic
  balance of flows. There is no agreed definition under the UNFCCC on what should
  count toward assessing progress toward the $100 billion commitment. Data from the
  UNFCCC secretariat refers to climate-specific financial support to developing country
  Parties, reported by Annex I Parties in their Biennial Reports. Only Annex II Parties
  are obligated to report on financial support provided and other Annex I Parties
  also voluntarily provide this information. Consequently, this data should not be
  interpreted as an indicator in relation to the achievement of the collective mobilization
  goal of $100 billion commitment. </p>
