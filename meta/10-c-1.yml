SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries</p>'
SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target: 10.c: By 2030, reduce to less than 3 per cent the transaction
  costs of migrant remittances and eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher
  than 5 per cent</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 10.c.1: Remittance costs as a proportion of the amount
  remitted</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>The target includes two components. The first component is that
  transaction costs for migrant remittances should be 3% or less by 2030. This transaction
  cost should be intended as <strong>&#x201C;</strong><strong>Global average total
  cost of sending $200 (or equivalent in local sending currency) and expressed as
  % of amount sent&#x201D;.</strong> This indicator is readily available and published
  on a quarterly basis by the World Bank in the Remittance Prices Worldwide database,
  which covers 365 country corridors, from 48 sending to 105 receiving countries.
  The second component is to eliminate corridor where cost is 5% or higher. This should
  be intended in the sense that it should be possible for remittance senders to send
  money to the beneficiary for an average cost of 5% or less of the amount sent. For
  this purpose, it should suffice that in each corridor there are at least 3 services,
  meeting a defined set of service requirements (including service quality, reach
  etc.), for which the average is 5% or less.</p>
