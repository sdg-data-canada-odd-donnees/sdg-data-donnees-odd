  The Open Data Inventory (ODIN) is an evaluation of the coverage and openness of data provided on the websites maintained by national statistical offices (NSOs) and any official government website that is accessible from the NSO site, as well as a country’s official SDG portal.
  </p>
  <p>
  ODIN measures the completeness of a countries’ statistical offerings (called, “coverage”) and how well those datasets meet international standards of data openness (called, “openness”). To determine the coverage and openness of datasets assessed in ODIN, ten elements are used.
  </p>
  <p>
  Coverage of data are measured by five elements that measure how complete the country’s data offerings are. Information on all elements are collected for each dataset assessed in ODIN, except for elements 4 and 5 that are not included for some data categories or for small countries. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The five coverage elements are:
  <ul>
  <li>Availability of indicators and disaggregations</li>
  <li>Availability of data in the last five years</li>
  <li>Availability of data in the last ten years</li>
  <li>Availability of data at the first administrative geographic level</li>
  <li>Availability of data at the second administrative geographic level</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  Openness of data are measured by five elements that measure how well a country’s data offerings meet international standards of openness.
  </p>
  <p>
  The five openness elements are:
  <ul>
  <li>Availability of data in machine readable format</li>
  <li>Availability of data in non-proprietary format</li>
  <li>Availability of reference metadata</li>
  <li>Availability of download options that make the data more accessible: bulk downloads, APIs, customizable data export options</li>
  <li>Availability of an open data license or open data terms of use</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  The availability of official statistics is expressed as an score from 0 to 100 — 0 expressing no availability and 100 expressing complete availability. <i>(Open Data Watch)</i>

  <strong>Indicator 17.18.1 (b)</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
  The Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI) assess the maturity and performance of national statistical systems in five key areas, called pillars. The five pillars are:
  <ol>
  <li> Data Use: Statistics have value only if they are used. A successful statistical system produces data that are used widely and frequently.</li>
  <li> Data Services: A range of services connects data users to producers and facilitate dialogues between them, thus building trust and a sense of value.</li>
  <li> Data Products: The dialogues between users and producers drive the design and range of statistical products and their accuracy, timeliness, frequency, comparability, and levels of disaggregation. The products signal whether countries are able to produce indicators related to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.</li>
  <li> Data Sources: To create useful products, the statistical system needs to draw on sources inside and outside the government. Data collection thus goes beyond the typical censuses and surveys to include administrative and geospatial data as well as data generated by private firms and citizens.</li>
  <li> Data Infrastructure: A mature statistical system has well-developed hard infrastructure (legislation, governance, standards) and soft infrastructure (skills, partnerships) as well as the financial resources to deliver useful—and widely used—data products and services.</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
  Each of these pillars is supported by four or five dimensions and uses defined methods and indicators.
  </p>
  <p>
  The scores for each pillar are calculated using the scores for the underlying dimensions, which in turn are derived from the values of their indicators. The overall SPI score is an average of the scores for the five pillars. For the overall score, a country can achieve a maximum of 100 and a minimum of 0. A score of 100 would indicate that a country has every single element that the SPI measures in place, and a score of 0 that none are in place. <i>(World Bank Group)</i>
