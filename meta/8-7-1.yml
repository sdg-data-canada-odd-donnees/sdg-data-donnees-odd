STAT_CONC_DEF: The number of children engaged in child labour corresponds to the number of children reported to be in 
child labour during the reference period (usually the week prior to the survey). The proportion of children 
in child labour is calculated as the number of children in child labour divided by the total number of 
children in the population. For the purposes of this indicator, children include all persons aged 5 to 17.
