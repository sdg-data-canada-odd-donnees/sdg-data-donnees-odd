SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 8.a.1: Aid for Trade commitments and disbursements</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>Aid for Trade commitments and disbursements is the gross disbursements
  and commitments of total Official Development Assistance (ODA) from all donors for
  aid for trade. Other official flows (OOF), excluding officially supported export credits, are defined as transactions by the 
  official sector which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not 
  primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional.</p>
DATA_COMP: '<p>The sum of ODA and OOF flows from all donors to developing countries for aid for trade.</p>'
REC_USE_LIM: '<p>Data in the Creditor Reporting System are available from 1973. However, the data coverage is considered 
  complete from 1995 for commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements.</p>'
