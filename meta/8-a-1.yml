SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 8.a.1: Aid for Trade commitments and disbursements</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: >-
  <p>This indicator measures gross disbursements and commitments of total Official Development Assistance (ODA) for aid for trade.
  <br><br>
  <i>Aid for trade</i> is captured in the OECD's Creditor Reporting System (CRS) under the following categories:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Trade policy and regulations and trade-related adjustment: captures trade policy and administrative management, trade facilitation, regional trade agreements, multilateral trade negociations, trade-related adjustment, and trade education/training.</li>
  <li>Economic infrastructure: covers the transport and storage sector, the communications sector, and the energy sector.</li>
  <li>Building productive capacity (including trade development): includes all activities in the productive and services sector. These are captured by the banking and financial services sector, business and other services, agriculture, forestry, fishing, industry, mineral resources and mining, and tourism sectors.</li>
  </ul>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Gross disbursements and commitments of ODA for aid for trade are calculated as the sum of all ODA disbursements or commitments belonging to these sectors:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Trade policies and regulations (CRS code 331)</li>
  <li>Transport and storage (CRS code 210)</li>
  <li>Communications (CRS code 220)</li>
  <li>Energy (CRS code 230)</li>
  <li>Banking and financial services (CRS code 240)</li>
  <li>Business and other services (CRS code 250)</li>
  <li>Agriculture (CRS code 311)</li>
  <li>Forestry (CRS code 312)</li>
  <li>Fishing (CRS code 313)</li>
  <li>Industry (CRS code 321)</li>
  <li>Mineral resources and mining (CRS code 322)</li>
  <li>Tourism (CRS code 332)</li>
  </ul>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  Aid for trade flows may be overestimated as the CRS purpose codes mentioned above are included regardless of whether there is an actual aid for trade contribution.
