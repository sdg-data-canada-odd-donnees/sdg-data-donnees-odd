  UNICEF and WHO have defined eight key food groups for infant and young children, which include: 1) breast milk; 2) grains, roots, and tubers; 3) pulses (beans, peas, lentils), nuts and seeds; 4) dairy products (milk, infant formula, yogurt, cheese); 5) flesh foods (meat, fish, poultry, organ meats; 6) eggs; 7) vitamin-A rich fruits and vegetables; and 8)other fruits and vegetables. Minimum dietary diversity is defined as the consumption of at least five out of the eight food groups. Consumption of any amount of food or beverage from a food group is sufficient to “count”, i.e., there is no minimum quantity.
