STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>The Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI) for Government Expenditures
  is defined as the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure, divided by the Agriculture
  value added share of GDP, where Agriculture refers to the agriculture, forestry,
  fishing and hunting sector. The measure is a currency-free index, calculated as
  the ratio of these two shares. National governments are requested to compile Government
  Expenditures according to the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) and the Classification
  of the Functions of Government (COFOG), and Agriculture value added share of GDP
  according to the System of National Accounts (SNA).</p>
