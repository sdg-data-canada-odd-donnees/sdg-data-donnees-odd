SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and
  sanitation for all</p>'
SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 6.4: By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across
  all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address
  water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water
  scarcity</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 6.4.2: Level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as
  a proportion of available freshwater resources</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: '<p>The level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion
  of available freshwater resources is the ratio between total freshwater withdrawn
  by all major sectors and total renewable freshwater resources, after taking into
  account environmental flow requirements. Main sectors, as defined by ISIC standards,
  include agriculture; forestry and fishing; manufacturing; electricity industry;
  and services. This indicator is also known as water withdrawal intensity.
  <br>
  <br>Above 25% of water stress, four classes have been identified to signal different levels of stress severity;
  <br>
  <br>- No stress <25%
  <br>
  <br>- Low 25% - 50%
  <br>
  <br>- Medium 50% - 75%
  <br>
  <br>- High 75-100%
  <br>
  <br>- Critical >100%</p>'

REC_USE_LIM: '<p>Freshwater withdrawal as a percentage of renewable freshwater resources is a good indicator of pressure 
  on limited water resources, one of the most important natural resources. However, it only partially 
  addresses the issues related to sustainable water management.
  <br>
  <br>Trends in freshwater withdrawal show relatively slow patterns of change. Usually, three-five years are a 
  minimum frequency to be able to detect significant changes, as it is unlikely that the indicator would 
  show meaningful variations from one year to the other.</p>'
