STAT_CONC_DEF: |
  Sub-indicator 15.4.2a, Mountain Green Cover Index (MGCI), is designed to measure the extent and changes 
  of green cover - i.e. forest, shrubs, trees, pasture land, cropland, etc. – in mountain areas. MGCI is defined 
  as the percentage of green cover over the total surface of the mountain area of a given country and for 
  given reporting year. The aim of the index is to monitor the evolution of green cover and thus assess the 
  status of conservation of mountain ecosystems. <br><br> Sub-indicator 15.4.2b, Proportion of degraded mountain land, is designed to monitor the extent of 
  degraded mountain land as a result of land cover change in a given country and for given reporting year. 
  Similarly to sub-indicator ‘‘trends in land cover” under SDG Indicator 15.3.1 (Sims et al. 2021), mountain 
  ecosystem degradation and recovery is assessed based on the definition of land cover type transitions that 
  indicate improving, stable or degrading conservation status. The definition of degradation adopted for the 
  computation of this indicator is the one established Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on 
  Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).
