STAT_CONC_DEF: |
  <b>The Mountain Green Cover Index (MGCI)</b> is designed to measure the
  extent and the changes of green vegetation in mountain areas - i.e. forest, shrubs,
  trees, pasture land, cropland, etc. - in order to monitor progress towards
  the mountain target. MGCI is defined as the percentage of green cover over the total
  surface of the mountain region of a given country and for given reporting year.
  The aim of the index is to monitor the evolution of the green cover and thus assess
  the status of conservation of mountain ecosystems.
