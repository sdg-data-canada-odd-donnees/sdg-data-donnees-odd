  Given that the vast majority of youth aged 25 to 29 have completed their education, it is relevant to measure Not in employment, education or training (NEET) rates by the highest level of education attained within this age group. This measure is not presented for 15 to 24 year olds, as the majority of youth in this age group are still in school.<br><br>Estimates are based on an 8-month average for the calendar year (i.e. January to April and September to December).<br><br>Non-students are people who are not enrolled at an educational institution, as per Labour Force Survey (LFS) concepts.
