  Real GDP per capita in time t = Real GDP in time t / total population in time t

  Annual growth rate of real GPD per capita (in %) = (((Real GDP per capita at time t) - (Real GDP per capita at time t-1)) / (Real GDP per capita at time t-1)) Ã— 100
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  GDP data for this indicator is calculated using 2017 chained Canadian dollars as opposed to constant US dollars at 2015 prices as stated in the global metadata.
PROGRESS_DETAILS: |-
  The progress status for this indicator is calculated using the real GDP per capita measured in 2017 chained Canadian dollars. This unit of measure serves as an equivalent alternative to the percentage annual growth rate of real GDP per capita, which is incompatible with the progress measurement methodology. For more information, please refer to the progress measurement methodology documentation.
  <br><br>
  Progress is measured without a quantitative target. The 7% annual growth rate target for least developed countries is not applicable to Canada.
