  Births for Yukon are not available from 2017 to 2022, inclusively. As a result of delays with birth registrations, fewer births have been captured, to date, for Manitoba in 2021 and 2022. There were also fewer births captured for Nova Scotia in 2021 due to completeness issues. Other provinces and territories may also have been affected and the 2021 and 2022 births data will be revised with subsequent releases. Consequently, trends in the fertility rates and total fertility rate for the years 2021 and 2022 should be interpreted with caution.
