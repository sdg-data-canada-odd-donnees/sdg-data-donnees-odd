DATA_COMP: |
    The proportion of “small-scale industries” in total value added is an indicator calculated as a share of value added for small-scale manufacturing enterprises in total manufacturing value added: <i>Manufactured value added of "small-scale industries" / Total Manufacturing value added</i>
    <br><br><b>Manufactured value added</b> is production less consumption. 
    <br><br><b>Production</b> = (Revenue from goods manufactured + (Closing inventories, goods or work in process + Closing inventories, finished goods manufactured) - (Opening inventories, goods or work in process + Opening inventories, finished goods manufactured))
    <br><br><b>Consumption</b> = (Opening inventories, raw materials + Cost of materials and supplies + Total cost of energy, water utility and vehicle fuel - Closing inventories of raw materials)
