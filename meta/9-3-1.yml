STAT_CONC_DEF: 'Small-scale industrial enterprises, in the SDG framework also called “small-scale industries”, defined here 
  for the purpose of statistical data collection and compilation refer to statistical units, generally enterprises, 
  engaged in production of goods and services for market below a designated size class. <br><br> Proportion of “small-scale industries” in total industry value added represents an indicator calculating the 
  share of manufacturing value added of small-scale manufacturing enterprises in the total manufacturing 
  value added.'
DATA_COMP: |
    The proportion of “small-scale industries” in total value added is an indicator calculated as a share of value added for small-scale manufacturing enterprises in total manufacturing value added: <i>Manufactured value added of "small-scale industries" / Total Manufacturing value added</i>
    <br><br><b>Manufactured value added</b> is production less consumption. 
    <br><br><b>Production</b> = (Revenue from goods manufactured + (Closing inventories, goods or work in process + Closing inventories, finished goods manufactured) - (Opening inventories, goods or work in process + Opening inventories, finished goods manufactured))
    <br><br><b>Consumption</b> = (Opening inventories, raw materials + Cost of materials and supplies + Total cost of energy, water utility and vehicle fuel - Closing inventories of raw materials)
