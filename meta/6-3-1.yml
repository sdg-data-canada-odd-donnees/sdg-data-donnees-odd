    Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
SDG_TARGET: |
    Target: 6.3: By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally.
SDG_INDICATOR: |
    Indicator: 6.3.1: Proportion of domestic and industrial wastewater flows safely treated
STAT_CONC_DEF: 'This indicator measures the volumes of wastewater which are generated through different activities, and 
the volumes of wastewater which are safely treated before discharge into the environment. Both of 
these indicators are measured in units of 1000 m3/day, although some data sources may use other units 
that require conversion. The ratio of the volume treated to the volume generated is taken as the ‘proportion of wastewater flow safely treated’.'
