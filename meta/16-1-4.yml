    Victimization surveys (as dedicated surveys or as modules of household surveys) are usually restricted to 
    the general population living in households above a certain age (typically 15 or 18 years of age), while 
    sometimes an upper age limit is also applied (typically 65, 70 or 75 years of age).
    <br>
    <br>There are several limitations associated with the wording of the survey question used to measure fear of 
    crime (‘How safe do you feel walking alone in your area/neighbourhood after dark?’). First, the question 
    assumes that respondents do the following: (1) go out, (2) go out alone, (3) go out in their neighbourhood,
    and (4) go out after dark. For many respondents, the reasons for not going out alone in their neighbourhood 
    after dark may have nothing or little to do with crime and more to do with personal and circumstantial 
    issues, such aslack of mobility, childcare commitments, or the use of a car that allows them to travel further 
    afield. Second, the question does not define the meaning of “neighbourhood”, which may mean different 
    things to different respondents, even those living in the same street. Third, the question does not explicitly 
    refer to ‘crime’, but rather it is implicit in the question. There may be other reasons unrelated to crime (e.g. 
    wild animals, traffic, etc.) why respondents may not feel safe walking around their neighbourhood after 
    dark.

    <br>"Total – Visible minority" includes population aged 15 years and over. "Visible minority" refers to whether 
    a person is a visible minority or not, as defined by the Employment Equity Act. The Employment Equity Act defines
    visible minorities as "persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in 
    colour." The visible minority population consists mainly of the following groups: South Asian, Chinese, Black, 
    Filipino, Arab, Latin American, Southeast Asian, West Asian, Korean and Japanese. Data for the category of "West 
    Asian", "Korean", "Japanese", "Visible minority", "Not included elsewhere", "Multiple visible minorities" and "Not 
    Stated" are included in the "Total – Visible minority".
