SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages</p>'
SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 3.2: By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children
  under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to
  at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as
  low as 25 per 1,000 live births</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 3.2.2: Neonatal mortality rate</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>The neonatal mortality rate is the probability that a child born
  in a specific year or period will die during the first 28 completed days of life
  if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live
  births.</p>
DATA_COMP: custom.data-comp
REC_USE_LIM: |
  During the production of each year's birth/death/stillbirth statistics, data from previous years may be revised to reflect any updates or changes that have been received from the provincial and territorial vital statistics registrars. 
  <br>
  <br>Due to improvements in methodology and timeliness, the duration of data collection has been shortened compared to previous years. 
  As a result, there may have been fewer deaths captured by the time of the release.
  <br>
  <br>The 2023 data is considered preliminary. 
  <br>
  <br>Data for Yukon are not available for 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022.
