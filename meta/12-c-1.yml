SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 12.c.1: Amount of fossil-fuel subsidies per unit of GDP
  (production and consumption)</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: '<p>In order to measure fossil fuel subsidies at the national, regional
  and global level, three sub-indicators are recommended for reporting on this indicator:
  1) direct transfer of government funds; 2) induced transfers (price support); and
  as an optional sub-indicator 3) tax expenditure, other revenue foregone, and under-pricing
  of goods and services. The definitions of the IEA Statistical Manual (IEA, 2005)
  and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) under the World
  Trade Organization (WTO) (WTO, 1994) are used to define fossil fuel subsidies. Standardised
  descriptions from the United Nations Statistical Office&#x2019;s Central Product
  Classification should be used to classify individual energy products. It is proposed
  to drop the wording &#x201C;as a proportion of total national expenditure on fossil
  fuels&#x201D; and thus this indicator is effectively &quot;Amount of fossil fuel
  subsidies per unit of GDP (production and consumption)&quot;.</p>'
