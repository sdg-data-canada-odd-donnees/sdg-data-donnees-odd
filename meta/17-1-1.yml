STAT_CONC_DEF: 'Revenue is defined in Chapter 4 (paragraph 4.23) of Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2014
  as an increase in net worth resulting from a transaction. It is a fiscal indicator for assessing the 
  sustainability of fiscal activities. General government units have four types of revenue. The major types of 
  revenue are taxes (GFS code 11), social contributions (GFS code 12), grants (GFS code 13), and other 
  revenue (GFS code 14). Of these, compulsory levies and transfers are the main sources of revenue for 
  most general government units. In particular, taxes are compulsory, unrequited amounts receivable by 
  government units from institutional units. Social contributions are actual or imputed revenue receivable 
  by social insurance schemes to make provision for social insurance benefits payable. Grants are transfers 
  receivable by government units from other resident or non-resident government units or international 
  organizations, and that do not meet the definition of a tax, subsidy, or social contribution. Other revenue is all revenue receivable excluding taxes, social contributions, and grants. Other revenue comprises: (i) 
  property income; (ii) sales of goods and services; (iii) fines, penalties, and forfeits; (iv) transfers not 
  elsewhere classified; and (v) premiums, fees, and claims related to non-life insurance and standardized 
  guarantee schemes.'
