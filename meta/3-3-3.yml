  Indicator 3.3.3: Malaria incidence per 100,000 population
STAT_CONC_DEF: |-
  Incidence of malaria is defined as the number of new cases of malaria per 100,000 population each year.
DATA_COMP: custom.data-comp
REC_USE_LIM: |-
  This is a proxy indicator. The UN Global indicator states: "Malaria incidence per 1,000 population". <br><br>
  The national data for indicator 3.3.3 measures malaria incidence per 100,000 population, rather than per 1,000 population as specified in the metadata. <br><br>
  Total population is used as the denominator for the calculation of malaria incidence, rather than the population at risk.
  <br><br>
  From 2013 through 2016, Quebec data may include probable cases of malaria.
  <br><br>
  From 2018 to 2022, Ontario data has been omitted from the national rate calculation, as the province no longer includes malaria as a disease of interest for public health monitoring.
PROGRESS_DETAILS: |-
  The target for this indicator is a 90% reduction in the incidence rate by 2030, compared to 2015 levels, as established in the World Health Organization's [Global technical strategy for malaria 2016â€“2030](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/253469/A68_R1_REC1-en.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y).
