  This is a proxy indicator. The UN Global indicator states: "Malaria incidence per 1,000 population". <br><br>
  The national data for indicator 3.3.3 measures malaria incidence per 100,000 population, rather than per 1,000 population as specified in the metadata. <br><br>
  Total population is used as the denominator for the calculation of malaria incidence, rather than the population at risk. <br><br>
  From 2013 through 2016, Quebec data may include probable cases of malaria. <br><br>
  From 2018 to 2022, Ontario data has been omitted from the national rate calculation, as the province no longer includes malaria as a disease of interest for public health monitoring.
