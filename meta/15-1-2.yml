SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial
  ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse
  land degradation and halt biodiversity loss</p>'
SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 15.1: By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable
  use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular
  forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international
  agreements </p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 15.1.2: Proportion of important sites for terrestrial
  and freshwater biodiversity that are covered by protected areas, by ecosystem type</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: |
  The indicator "Proportion of important sites for terrestrial and
  freshwater biodiversity that are covered by protected areas, by ecosystem type" shows
  temporal trends in the mean percentage of each important site for terrestrial and
  freshwater biodiversity (i.e., those that contribute significantly to the global
  persistence of biodiversity) that is covered by designated protected areas and Other
  Effective Area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs). 
  <br><br>
  <b>Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs)</b> are sites that contribute significantly to the global 
  persistence of biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. They are 
  identified through national processes by local stakeholders using a set of globally 
  agreed scientific criteria.
