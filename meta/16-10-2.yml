SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development,
  provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive
  institutions at all levels</p>'
SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 16.10: Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental
  freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 16.10.2: Number of countries that adopt and implement
  constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: |
  Number of countries that adopt and implement constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for 
  public access to information.
  <br>
  <br>The purpose of this indicator is to report the total of number of countries that adopted legal guarantees 
  on access to information (ATI), as well as the main tendencies in the implementation of these guarantees, which 
  are presented in global aggregates.
  <br>
  <br>Based on the definition above, the indicator has two components:
  <br>1. Adoption
  <br>2. Implementation
  <br>
  <br>Under each component, key questions were identified based on what can be called “Principles of Access 
  to Information”, and which highlight essential components for effective implementation of Access to 
  Information implementation at the country level. These Principles are synthesized from existing 
  frameworks and documents recognised internationally. For the purpose of this survey, the principles of 
  relevance are as follows:
  <br>
  <br>1. Legal frameworks for Access to Information 
  <br>2. Limited exemptions
  <br>3. Oversight mechanism 
  <br>4. Appeals mechanism
  <br>5. Record keeping and reporting
  <br>
  <br>Each question values between 0 and 2. Upon the completion of the survey, a country can get a total score 
  of 0-9. The total score of each country will not be assigned to any level category (e.g.: low, medium or 
  high). However, it will contribute to global aggregates.
