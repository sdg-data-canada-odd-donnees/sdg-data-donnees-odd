SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 9.4.1: CO<sub>2</sub> emission per unit of value added</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>Carbon dioxide (here after, CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions per unit of
  value added is an indicator computed as ratio between CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from
  fuel combustion and the value added of associated economic activities. The indicator
  can be computed for the whole economy (total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions/GDP) or for
  specific sectors, notably the manufacturing sector (CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from
  manufacturing industries per manufacturing value added (MVA). </p>
