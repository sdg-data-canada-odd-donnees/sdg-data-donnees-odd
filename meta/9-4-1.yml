STAT_CONC_DEF: |
  This indicator measures the GHG emission intensity relative to Canadaâ€™s economic activity. A decreasing trend would mean that less GHG emissions are emitted for one unit of GDP. <br><br>
  The data are presented in megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2 eq.) per billion dollars GDP.
