    Indicator 7.3.1: Energy intensity
STAT_CONC_DEF: >-
    This indicator measures energy intensity which is defined as the energy use per unit of gross domestic product (GDP). This is expressed as terajoules per million dollars of real GDP.
DATA_COMP: >-
    Energy intensity = energy use, final demand / Real GDP, expenditure based, at market prices (chained 2017 Canadian dollars)
REC_USE_LIM: >-
    This is a proxy indicator. The UN Global indicator states: “Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP”. This indicator measures the energy use, final demand in terms of GDP rather than the energy supplied to the economy per unit value of economic output as specified in the metadata.
