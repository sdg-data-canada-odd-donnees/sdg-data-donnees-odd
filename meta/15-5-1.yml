SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial
  ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse
  land degradation and halt biodiversity loss</p>'
SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 15.5: Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation
  of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent
  the extinction of threatened species</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 15.5.1: Red List Index</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: The Red List Index measures change in aggregate extinction risk across groups of species. It is based on 
  genuine changes in the number of species in each category of extinction risk on The IUCN Red List of 
  Threatened Species (www.iucnredlist.org) is expressed as changes in an index ranging from 0 to 1.
DATA_COMP: |
  Calculated based on the proportional change in population size for monitored 
  vertebrate species. All species are weighted equally, such that a species that doubled in 
  population would be balanced out by a species that declined by half. A long-term decline 
  from the 1970 baseline appears to be continuing. However, short-term fluctuations should 
  not be interpreted as strong evidence of recent environmental change.
REC_USE_LIM: |
  This is a proxy indicator. The UN Global indicator states: "Red List Index".
