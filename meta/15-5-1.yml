SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial
  ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse
  land degradation and halt biodiversity loss</p>'
SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 15.5: Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation
  of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent
  the extinction of threatened species</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 15.5.1: Canadian Species Index</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: |
  The Canadian species index represents the average percent change in the abundances of Canadian vertebrate species' populations since 1970. The index is an "average of trends", rather than a measure of change in the total number of animals: each species, whether it is common or rare, has the same effect on the index. The index reports general trends rather than progress towards desired levels.
DATA_COMP: custom.data-comp
REC_USE_LIM: |
  This is a proxy indicator presenting the Canadian Species Index rather than the Red List Index as specified by the metadata.
