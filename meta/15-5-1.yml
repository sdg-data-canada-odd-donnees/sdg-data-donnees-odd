STAT_CONC_DEF: |
  The Canadian species index represents the average percent change in the abundances of Canadian vertebrate species' populations since 1970. The index is an "average of trends", rather than a measure of change in the total number of animals: each species, whether it is common or rare, has the same effect on the index.
  <br><br>
  Animal wildlife populations depend on healthy habitats and can be negatively impacted by threats, such as pollution, habitat degradation or overhunting. The status of wildlife populations is a key factor that contribute to ecosystem health and species' resilience to threats. Trends in animal populations can provide an indication of the health of biodiversity and ecosystems in Canada. <em>Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)</em>
DATA_COMP: The national index includes 928 species of birds, fish,
  mammals, amphibians and reptiles. The number of species represents 52% of the 1
  798 native vertebrate species that regularly occur in Canada. Birds are the best
  represented species group, with about 89% of all bird species regularly occurring
  in Canada represented. 35% of native fish species as well as 55% of native mammal
  species are represented. Amphibians and reptiles are the least represented species
  group, as the data for the species regularly occurring in Canada have poor geographical
  coverage across the reporting period.  <em>(ECCC)</em>
REC_USE_LIM: |
  The national trend is the average rate of change across all
  monitored vertebrate species. The indices may reflect changes in data availability.
  Data are not available for all species and do not always cover the geographic range
  of each species or the whole time period reported. While large scale trends broadly
  reflect environmental change, smaller scale subindices can be subject to change
  if species with a different trajectory are added. The index should be interpreted
  with these limitations in mind. <em>(ECCC)</em>
