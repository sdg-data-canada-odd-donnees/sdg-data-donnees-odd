DATA_COMP: |
  Calculated based on the proportional change in population size for monitored 
  vertebrate species. All species are weighted equally, such that a species that doubled in 
  population would be balanced out by a species that declined by half. A long-term decline 
  from the 1970 baseline appears to be continuing. However, short-term fluctuations should 
  not be interpreted as strong evidence of recent environmental change.
