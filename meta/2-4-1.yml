  Farm output value per hectare includes both crops and livestock. Land productivity is 
  a measure of agricultural value of outputs obtained on a given area of land. Maintaining 
  or improving the output over time relative to the area of land used is an important aspect 
  in sustainability for a range of reasons. At farm level, the land productivity reflects 
  technology and production processes for given agro-ecological conditions. In a broader 
  sense, an increase in the level of land productivity enables higher production while 
  reducing pressure on increasingly scarce land resources, commonly linked to deforestation 
  and associated losses of ecosystem services and biodiversity. 
  <br>
  <br>Risk mitigation mechanisms measures whether the farm has the mitigation measures to 
  cope with external shocks: 
  <br>1. access to or availed credit 
  <br>2. access to or availed insurance
  <br>3. on farm diversification (share of a single agricultural commodity not greater than 
  60% in the total value of production of the holding.

    Data is only available to report on selected supplementary series. <br><br> Census of Agriculture's (CEAG) 'gross farm receipts' is used as a proxy to 'farm output value'. This variable may not exactly coincide with the FAO's 'farm output value' definition. <br><br> All farms have access to credit and insurance. They can apply to income, and commodity insurance programs developed by federal and provincial governments.
