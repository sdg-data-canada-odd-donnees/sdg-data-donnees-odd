SDG_GOAL: 'Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and
  promote sustainable agriculture'
SDG_TARGET: 'Target 2.4: By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural 
  practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen 
  capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and 
  that progressively improve land and soil quality'
SDG_INDICATOR: 'Indicator 2.4.1: Progress towards productive and sustainable agriculture'
STAT_CONC_DEF: >
  Data on the official SDG indicator 2.4.1 is currently scarce, as countries still build their capacity to adapt their agricultural surveys to collect the necessary information. 
  As a provisional, stop-gap solution, the UN Statistical Commission has approved the use of a proxy for monitoring progress towards productive and sustainable agriculture, based on widely available national-level statistics.
  <br><br>
  According to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the performance of all sectors, including agriculture, 
  must be assessed against the three dimensions of sustainability: economic, social and environmental.
  <br><br>
  For each country, scores are assigned to each sub-indicator, and the average score determines the classification of the country into one of five 
  bands with respect to the trend towards productive and sustainable agriculture as well as status with 
  respect to productive and sustainable agriculture, as follows:
  <br><br>
  <ul>
  <li>Band 1 (Score 1 to <1.5): Deterioration away from productive and sustainable agriculture</li>
  <li>Band 2 (Score 1.5 to <2.5): Slight deterioration from productive and sustainable agriculture</li>
  <li>Band 3 (Score 2.5 to <3.5): No improvement towards productive and sustainable agriculture</li>
  <li>Band 4 (Score 3.5 to <4.5): Slight improvement towards productive and sustainable agriculture</li>
  <li>Band 5 (Score 4.5 to 5): Improvement towards productive and sustainable agriculture</li>
  </ul>
