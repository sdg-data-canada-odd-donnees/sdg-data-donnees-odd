  The indicator 17.19.2 (a) tracks the proportion of countries that have conducted at least one population and housing 
  census in the last 10 years. This also includes countries which compile their detailed population and 
  housing statistics from population registers, administrative records, sample surveys or other sources or a 
  combination of those sources</p><p>Indicator 17.19.02b has two parts; the first concerning the birth registration and the second concerning the death registration of each individual country or area. <br><br>
  According to the Principles and Recommendations for a Vital Statistics System, Revision 3 (<a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/standmeth/principles/M19Rev3en.pdf">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/standmeth/principles/M19Rev3en.pdf)</a>, a complete civil 
  registration is defined as: “The registration in the civil registration system of every vital event that has occurred to the members of the population of a particular country (or area), within a specified period as a 
  result of which every such event has a vital registration record and the system has attained 100 per cent 
  coverage.” <br><br>
  In a given country or area, the level of completeness of birth registration can be different from the level 
  of completeness of death registration.
