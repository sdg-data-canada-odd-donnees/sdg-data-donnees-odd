STAT_CONC_DEF: '<strong><p>Indicator 6.2.1a:</p></strong> <p>The proportion of the population using safely managed sanitation services is defined as the proportion of 
the population using an improved sanitation facility which is not shared with other households and where 
excreta are safely disposed of in situ or removed and treated off-site. ‘Improved’ sanitation facilities are 
those designed to hygienically separate human excreta from human contact. These include wet sanitation 
technologies such as flush and pour flush toilets connected to sewers, septic tanks or pit latrines, and dry sanitation technologies such as dry pit latrines with slabs, ventilated improved pit latrines and composting
toilets.</p> <strong><p>Indicator 6.2.1b:</p></strong> <p>The proportion of the population with basic hygiene services is defined as the proportion of population 
with a handwashing facility with soap and water available at home. Handwashing facilities may be 
located within the dwelling, yard or plot. They may be fixed or mobile and include a sink with tap water, 
buckets with taps, tippy-taps, and jugs or basins designated for handwashing. Soap includes bar soap, liquid soap, powder detergent, and soapy water but does not include ash, soil, sand or other 
handwashing agents.</p>'
