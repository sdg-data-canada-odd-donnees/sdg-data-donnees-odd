SDG_INDICATOR: |
  Indicator 17.16.1: Canada's multi-stakeholder frameworks and strategy that supports and monitors the achievement of nationally focused sustainable development goals
STAT_CONC_DEF: |
  The indicator tracks the multi-stakeholder monitoring frameworks that track the implementation of development effectiveness commitments supporting the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). <br><br>
  Multi-stakeholder development effectiveness monitoring frameworks” that track effective development cooperation are monitoring frameworks: 
  <br> - whose indicators have been agreed on a voluntary basis; whose indicators measure the strength of the relationship between development actors; 
  <br> - where data collection and review are led by the countries themselves; and where participation in data collection and review involves relevant stakeholders representing, at minimum, the public  sector, the private sector and civil society organizations.
  <br><br>
  The indicator takes into account the need to capture the respective roles and responsibilities of all parties involved in multi-stakeholder partnerships for development. It does so by looking at development effectiveness frameworks that are led by countries but include the participation of all relevant development partners.
