SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 2.c.1: Indicator of food price anomalies</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>The indicator of food price anomalies (IFPA) identifies market prices
  that are abnormally high. The IFPA relies on a weighted compound growth rate that
  accounts for both within year and across year price growth. The indicator directly
  evaluates growth in prices over a particular month over many years, taking into
  account seasonality in agricultural markets and inflation, allowing to answer the
  question of whether or not a change in price is abnormal for any particular period.</p>
