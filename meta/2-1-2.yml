REC_USE_LIM: |
      This is a proxy indicator. The UN Global indicator states: "Prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in the population, based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES)". 
      The survey is conducted nationwide, in both the provinces and
      the territories. It covers all individuals in Canada, excluding persons living on
      reserves and other Indigenous settlements in the provinces, the institutionalized
      population, and households in extremely remote areas with very low population density.
      Overall, these exclusions amount to less than two percent of the population.
