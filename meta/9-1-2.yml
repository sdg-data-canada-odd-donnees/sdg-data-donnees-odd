  Indicator 9.1.2: Passenger and freight volumes
STAT_CONC_DEF: >-
  This indicator measures passenger and freight volumes for air, rail and road transportation. A growth in passenger and freight volumes is indicative of robust infrastructure development along with resultant socio-economic benefit. Air transport is particularly important not only for the economic and job benefits but also because it is one of the only modes of transport that can be relied on during emergencies and disease outbreaks to reach food, medicines, medical personnel, vaccines, and other supplies speedily to the affected persons in the affected areas.
DATA_COMP: custom.data-comp
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  This is a proxy indicator that measures passenger volumes by the number of passengers and freight volumes by metric tonnes, whereas the UN metadata states: "Passenger volumes are measured in passenger-kilometres while freight volumes are measured in tonne-kilometres".
