  and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 9.1.2: Passenger and freight volumes, by mode of transport</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: 'Passenger volumes are measured in passenger-kilometres while freight volumes are measured in tonne-kilometres, and broken down by mode of transport. For the purposes of monitoring this indicator, 
  passenger-km data are split between aviation, road (broken down between passenger cars, buses and 
  motorcycles) and rail, and tonne-km are split between aviation, road, rail and inland waterways. 
  Maritime freight is measured in metric tons and container port traffic is measured in twenty-foot 
  equivalent unit (TEU)'
