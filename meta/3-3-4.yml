SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 3.3: By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria
  and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other
  communicable diseases </p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 3.3.4: Hepatitis B incidence per 100,000 population </p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>This indicator measures the prevalence of the Hepatitis B surface antigen in children under five years of age.</p> 
  <p>This indicator is measured indirectly through the proportion of children 5 years of age who have developed chronic HBV infection (i.e. the proportion that tests positive for a marker of infection called hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]).</p>
DATA_COMP: 'Hepatitis B incidence in children under five years of age per 100,000 population = ([Number of cases in children under 1 year + Number of cases in children aged 1 to 4 years] / Population aged 0 to 4 years) x 100,000'
REC_USE_LIM: 'Hepatitis B reporting does not differentiate between acute and chronic cases.'
