The second component is to eliminate corridor where cost is 5% or higher. This should be intended in the sense that it should be possible for remittance senders to send money to the beneficiary for an average cost of 5% or less of the amount sent. For this purpose, it should suffice that in each corridor there are at least 3 services, meeting a defined set of service requirements (including service quality, reach etc.), for which the average is 5% or less.</p>","SDG_GOAL__GLOBAL":"<p>Goal 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries</p>","SDG_TARGET__GLOBAL":"<p>Target: 10.c: By 2030, reduce to less than 3 per cent the transaction costs of migrant remittances and eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher than 5 per cent</p>","SDG_INDICATOR__GLOBAL":"<p>Indicator 10.c.1: Remittance costs as a proportion of the amount remitted</p>","fr":{"SDG_GOAL":"<p>Objectif 10 : R\u00e9duire les in\u00e9galit\u00e9s dans les pays et d\u2019un pays \u00e0 l\u2019autre</p>","SDG_TARGET":"<p>Cible 10.c : D\u2019ici \u00e0 2030, faire baisser au-dessous de 3\u00a0pour\u00a0cent les co\u00fbts de transaction des envois de fonds effectu\u00e9s par les\u00a0migrants et \u00e9liminer les circuits d\u2019envois de fonds dont les co\u00fbts sont sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 5\u00a0pour\u00a0cent</p>","SDG_INDICATOR":"<p>Indicateur 10.c.1: Co\u00fbts des envois de fonds en proportion du\u00a0montant transf\u00e9r\u00e9</p>","STAT_CONC_DEF":[],"SDG_GOAL__GLOBAL":"<p>Objectif 10 : R\u00e9duire les in\u00e9galit\u00e9s dans les pays et d\u2019un pays \u00e0 l\u2019autre</p>","SDG_TARGET__GLOBAL":"<p>Cible 10.c : D\u2019ici \u00e0 2030, faire baisser au-dessous de 3\u00a0pour\u00a0cent les co\u00fbts de transaction des envois de fonds effectu\u00e9s par les\u00a0migrants et \u00e9liminer les circuits d\u2019envois de fonds dont les co\u00fbts sont sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 5\u00a0pour\u00a0cent</p>","SDG_INDICATOR__GLOBAL":"<p>Indicateur 10.c.1: Co\u00fbts des envois de fonds en proportion du\u00a0montant transf\u00e9r\u00e9</p>"},"national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-11-01","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-11-01: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-data-canada-odd-donnees/sdg-data-donnees-odd/commit/fab6a6cf10387e65cc6047529440d9353c0f6b33","indicator":"10.c.1","target_id":"10.c","sdg_goal":"10","indicator_sort_order":"10-0c-01"}
