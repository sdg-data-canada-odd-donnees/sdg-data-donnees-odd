On-time graduation rate is the percentage of a cohort of young people who complete their high school studies within three years of starting Grade 10 (\u201cSecondary 3\u201d in Quebec).  On-time graduation rate reflects the cohort entering Grade 10 (\"Secondary 3\" in Quebec) two school years prior to the reference year. For example, the data for reference year 2016/2017 represents the cohort entering Grade 10 (\"Secondary 3\" in Quebec) in 2014/2015. <br><br>\nHigh school graduation rate is calculated from Secondary 3 to Secondary 5 in Quebec, and Grades 10-12 in all other provinces. The true-cohort methodology uses two cohorts of students that begin in Grade 10 (\"Secondary 3\" in Quebec) to calculate the high school graduation rate (see <a href=\"https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/81-582-G\"> <em>Indicator C3</em></a> for more details). <br><br>\nComparisons of high school graduation rates between provinces and territories require a nuanced interpretation as academic pathways, pass marks, subject requirements and the groups of students under consideration may differ from one province or territory to another. International students are also included in the graduation cohort, which could impact comparing graduation rates, as the proportion of international students varies across provinces. <br><br>\nGraduation rates reported here may differ to what is reported at the provincial/territorial-level due to varying methodologies for the calculation of graduation rates by individual provinces and territories.'\n","SDG_GOAL__GLOBAL":"Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all","SDG_TARGET__GLOBAL":"Target 4.1: By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes","SDG_INDICATOR__GLOBAL":"Indicator 4.1.2: Completion rate (primary education, lower secondary education, upper secondary education)","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"UNESCO Institute for Statistics","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-04-01-02.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata","source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Statistics Canada.
